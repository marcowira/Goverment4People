# Goverment4People

Background: I don't really know how we exactly got here. Things are more complex, expensive and we seem to be living in a world that caters to specialzied groups over people. We can see this in everyting from taxes, to buying a car, to real estate, and even your credit report. Can it be better? I absolute think so and believe that platforms such as github allow us to collaborate to find a truely better way to find the solution and work towards improving our lives.

So let's start with something that I think we all struggle with and wish were better for ALL residents:

Let's 
Taxes - A simple progressive income tax and simple sales tax. I've heard really promising stories about how easy it is for Singaporeans to file their taxes each year. Can we expand on this?

Other ideas:
Health Care - Free universal healthcare for all legal residents
Identity - National online identity system with integrated oAuth to any service requiring identity
Education - Free education from pre-K through to Masters degrees
